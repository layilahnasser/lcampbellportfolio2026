The bold red interior and the from-scratch flavors set the tone, so I built the design system first and let color, type and photography carry the personality. Comparing four brands across eight features showed me what customers expect from an ice cream site, like a clear store locator, and where the original site fell short. This is a concept, so it has not been tested with real customers. Next I would test the Find Pints page with people choosing a shop and the image-forward browsing with first-time visitors, then adjust the design from what they do."

Building the system in light and dark mode from the start kept the screens consistent as the app grew. This is a design concept, so it has not been tested with contestants. Next I would run usability sessions with contestants on the readiness dashboard and flashcard practice, then design the answer-feedback flow."

        reflection: "Three things I would carry into the next project. First, who you recruit shapes what you learn: after feedback that our first two learner interviews shared one cultural context, we added an American participant, and the differences were real. Second, the interviews changed the question. We began with high-school graduates skipping college and learned that most alternative-pathway learners are already working and learning for life, so the design had to serve them. Third, synthesis is the hard part. Sorting hundreds of notes into themes was the most demanding stage, and it produced our strongest findings. If I did it again, I would bring education policymakers into the interviews, since we have no insight into how credentials are governed or recognized, and I would test the soft-skill tool first, because that is where Instructure's strategy and our research met."
